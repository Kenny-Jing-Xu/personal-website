I am a Research Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the [Center for Quantitative Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/cqm). Here, I am mentored by Associate Professor [Bibhas Chakraborty](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/bibhas/). We propose a flexible version of micro-randomized trial design, which can be used to optimize the just-in-time adaptive interventions for the mobile health research projects.

Prior to joining Duke-NUS,  I was an Assistant Professor at [Data Science Programme, Division of Science and Technology, Beijing Normal University-Hong Kong Baptist University United International college, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China](https://dst.uic.edu.cn/ds/). I had experienced as a Biostatician to support, proteomics and cancer studies at [Children Medical Research Institute, Westmead, NSW, Australia](https://www.cmrijeansforgenes.org.au), clinical trials at [Singapore Clinical Research Institute, Singapore](https://www.scri.edu.sg), neuroscience research at [Memory, Ageing and Cognition Centre, National University of Singapore, Singapore](http://www.macc.sg/About-MACC-Healthy-Aging-Dementia-Prevention), dementia research at [Dementia Centre for Research Collaboration, The University of New South Wales, Australia](https://dementiaresearch.org.au). 

I had completed my Honours and PhD in Statistics from 
[Macquarie University, Australia](https://www.mq.edu.au), 
    under the supervision of Associate Professor 
    [Jun Ma]( https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/jun-ma ).
My PhD research was about proportional hazard model estimation, under dependent censoring, using maximum penalized likelihood method. The proposed method was applied to analyze a dementia dataset.
